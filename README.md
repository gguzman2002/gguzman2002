### Hey there!

Thanks for visiting, I'm Gabriel. I'm a Web Developer who has currently discovered the awesomeness of C# and the .NET environment and I'm working on leveling up! Besides, I really appreciate clean, semantic HTML with minimal CSS. Take a look at my projects and skills below to see if I can be of service ðŸ˜Ž.
